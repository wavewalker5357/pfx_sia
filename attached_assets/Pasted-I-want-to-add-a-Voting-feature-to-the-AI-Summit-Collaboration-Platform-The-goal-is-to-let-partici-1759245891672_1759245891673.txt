I want to add a ‚ÄúVoting‚Äù feature to the AI Summit Collaboration Platform. The goal is to let participants vote on submitted ideas in a way that feels similar to EasyRetro.

What the feature should do
	‚Ä¢	Every participant gets a limited number of votes (e.g., 5) to distribute across ideas on the board.
	‚Ä¢	They can put multiple votes on one idea if they want, or spread them across different ideas.
	‚Ä¢	Participants can also remove votes and reallocate them.
	‚Ä¢	The system should always show them how many votes they still have left.
	‚Ä¢	Each idea card should show the total votes it has received.
	‚Ä¢	Organizers (admins) can configure the number of votes per participant and can open or close the voting phase.
	‚Ä¢	While voting is open, a banner at the top of the board should remind participants how many votes remain.
	‚Ä¢	When voting is closed, people can still see totals, but they can‚Äôt add or remove votes.
	‚Ä¢	The analytics dashboard should also include voting results (top voted ideas, total votes, etc.).

Rules
	‚Ä¢	A participant cannot exceed their allowed number of votes.
	‚Ä¢	Votes should be tied to a session ID, so if someone refreshes their browser, they keep their votes.
	‚Ä¢	Admin-only controls should stay hidden for attendees.
	‚Ä¢	Everything should match our current design system (light/dark mode, buttons, clean layout).

Acceptance criteria
	‚Ä¢	As a participant, I can give votes to ideas, see the total update immediately, and see my remaining votes update.
	‚Ä¢	As a participant, if I try to vote more than allowed, I get a friendly message (not a crash).
	‚Ä¢	As a participant, I can remove votes I already cast and reuse them.
	‚Ä¢	As an organizer, I can turn voting on/off and change the maximum votes per person in the admin panel.
	‚Ä¢	As an organizer, I can see which ideas have the most votes in the analytics dashboard.
	‚Ä¢	The app should stay smooth, responsive, and bug-free.

Important
	‚Ä¢	Keep it simple and consistent with the rest of the app.
	‚Ä¢	Don‚Äôt break existing features.
	‚Ä¢	Make sure voting feels fast and updates in real time (at least with regular refresh/polling).
	‚Ä¢	Build it so we can expand later if we want more advanced voting phases.

üëâ This is essentially the ‚Äúproduct spec‚Äù version of the same instructions: it tells the AI what outcome we want and why, leaving the how flexible.

Do you want me to also draft a shorter, 3‚Äì4 sentence ‚Äúexecutive style‚Äù prompt that focuses only on the vision (so the AI fills in all the details)?
